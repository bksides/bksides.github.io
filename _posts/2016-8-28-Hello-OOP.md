# Hello OOP!

**What I Did This Week:** This week involved discussions on unit testing with Google Test, as well as an examination of a few
examples of similarities/differences between Java and C++ and, of course, setting up this blog.  It's been fascinating to see
some of the features of C++ as they compare to Java and C: operator overloading is something I find to be of particular interest,
having incurred the inconvenience of having to write explicit functions for what are better written as arithmetic operations
multiple times.

**What's In My Way:** I've still got to get my hands on a GitHub student pack.  I've gone through the process of applying for one
but was notified that it may be days or even weeks before the application is approved.  Additionally I still feel a bit daunted
by the task of coming up with thorough unit tests; accounting for corner cases and accounting for potentially problematic inputs
is probably my least developed skill as a programmer, and for the moment I feel that that will hinder my ability to do good,
thorough testing.  Hopefully, my experience in this class will help me with that shortcoming.  Also, I've been having computer
trouble, which is a really big problem because I absolutely cannot afford to by myself a new laptop right now.  I'm hoping the one
I have now can make it through the semester, but if not I may have to very quickly find some other way to do what needs to be
done for this class.

**What I'll Do Next Week:** I plan to make next week all about C++.  I want to learn the ins and outs of the syntax and whatever
essential libriaries I might need.  My hope is that my familiarity with C will make this process a bit easier; at least I'm not
learning a whole language from scratch.  Certainly, one week won't be enough to know the whole language by heart, but I want to
at least feel comfortable working in it so that my C++ programming skills can keep up with the concepts we discuss in class.

**All In All:** my feelings about the class so far mostly involve excitement.  By the looks of it I'll be learning lots of useful
tools and techniques for writing, testing, and deploying software.  This class feels like it's gearing up to be an excellent
preparatory course for going to work in the software industry.

**Tip Of The Week:** [Codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/) is a great resource for honing your programming abilities, particularly when you're trying
to get the hang of a new language.  It allows people to train and compete with other developers to improve your skills.
